There is a dataset with thousands of a bank customers and some of their information.

Also there is a column named personal loan which have a binary categorization and it stores the customers information, if they got loan before or not.

In this notebook i want to train the dataset with 3 algorithms (Logistic regression - Na√Øve Bayes - KNN) for a recommendation goal. The purpose is : by the information that we will get from our new costumers, should we recommend loan to them or not ?
